<h3>
<span>UNPUBLISHED SONG BY THOMAS OTWAY.</span>
</h3>


<p>In turning over a quantity of miscellaneous papers in MS. (some
originals and some copies) of the latter half of the seventeenth century
(which chance lately threw in my way), I stumbled upon the following
song by the unfortunate author of <i>Venice Preserved</i>. It may, possibly,
have been printed in one, or more, of the numerous volumes of
"miscellany poems" which teemed from the press at the end of the
seventeenth and the beginning of the following century; but in looking
over a tolerable assemblage which time has accumulated on my shelves, I
have not been able to discover it. The MS. does not appear to be an
original, although the handwriting is of the author's period. The
punctuation is as I found it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p class="noindent">Charge it briskly to the brim,</p>
   <p class="noindent">Till the flying topsails swim:</p>
   <p class="noindent">We owe the great discovery to him</p>

     <p class="author"> "T. Otway."</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>That poor Otway was a lover of the "juice of the grape," is too well
known; and it seems from his biography in Cibber's <i>Lives of the Poets</i>,
that he was for some time a soldier, and served in Flanders. The
half-bacchanalian, half-military<a id="Page_338"></a> <span class="pagenum">[338]</span> character of this song, seems to
identify it with the poet. The popular story, that Otway died for want
at an ale-house on Tower Hill, is, it is to be hoped, not strictly true.
Dennis, the critic (as he is called), tells us that&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Otway had an intimate friend (one Blackstone), who was shot; the
   murderer fled towards Dover, and Otway pursued him. In his return
   he drank water when violently heated, and so got a fever, which
   was the death of him."</p>

<p>This story is creditable to the warmth of Otway's friendship, and I
should be glad to meet with any additional authority to give it
confirmation.</p>

<h3>
<span>SHAKSPEARE'S "WE THREE."</span>
</h3>

<p>In Shakspeare's <i>Twelfth Night</i>, a passage occurs upon which some
observations may be bestowed in the way of illustration, because, as it
is usually printed, no signification seems attributed to it, whereas in
reality it is a scrap of satire very appropriate to the character in
whose mouth it is placed. In Act II. Sc. 2., the clown, entering to the
two drunken knights, Sir Toby Belch and Sir Andrew Ague-cheek,
exclaims,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

   <p class="indh">  "How now, my hearts? Did you never see the picture<br />
    of we three?"</p>

</div>


<p>Of the innumerable editions of Shakspeare, I have examined only twelve,
my own and my neighbours', all which, without exception, present the
last two words of the quotation as above, without the slightest
difference from the remainder of the sentence; and, when annotations are
given, without any explanatory remark save in three instances, which
will hereafter be noticed. From this circumstance and this coincidence
it may be inferred, that the editors generally did not imagine the words
in question to contain any special meaning, but possibly understood them
as merely an illiterate blunder for "<i>us</i> three." Any such idea,
however, would be a misapprehension. For although the clown is
introduced as an allowed fool, and so entitled, it is evident he was
designed to represent a person not totally devoid of at least some
smattering of learning, as well as to be, what one of his brethren is
styled, "a shrewd knave;" as such, being manifestly quite capable of
duly appreciating his two knightly patrons. Which knowledge on the part
of the clown increases the probability that such an "all licensed"
personage should, under the disguise of a jest, insinuate the contempt
he really felt, and which the others so richly deserve; for this, it
will speedily appear, is the sense now contended for of the passage
above cited. Secondly, if the words are to stand as already read, "Did
you never see the picture of we three?" intimating no allusion to any
idea, hinted at but not expressed, they are simply an inquiry respecting
a painting of the knights and the clown, to the existence of which there
is not another reference throughout the entire play, neither does the
story require or suggest that the notion of any such painting should
ever have entered the author's mind.</p>

<p>In Theobald's <i>Shakspeare</i>, the sentence we are considering is
unnoticed, but, as previously stated, that is not the case in three of
the twelve editions consulted. In one, a single volume with glossary,
&amp;c., by Nicholas Rowe, to the words "we three," a foot note is appended,
supplying, as the conclusion of the phrase, "loggerheads be." The same
note is similarly given in another copy in nine volumes. The third
instance is an edition in two volumes, with explanatory notes at the
end, among which we find this respecting <i>Twelfth Night</i>:&mdash;"<i>Did you
never see the picture of we three?</i> an allusion to an old print
frequently pasted on alehouse walls, representing <i>two</i>, but under which
the spectator reads, <i>We three are asses</i>;" the name of Malone being
added as the authority for this interpretation.<a id="ion1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Without denying that
Malone may have possessed sufficient grounds for his statement, it may
be permitted to deliver an opinion, and to subjoin the following remarks
as a reason for thinking that Rowe's explanation is the better of the
two.</p>

<p>In the town of Tonbridge in Kent, south of the bridge over the Medway,
on the western side of the street, stands (or did recently) a
public-house, the sign of which I have long believed to illustrate the
passage before us. When first I observed the sign, from forty-five to
fifty years ago, and for long afterwards, one side, if not both,
presented <i>two</i> grotesque heads, the painting being not modern, so far
as my (rather vivid) recollection serves, with the legend "We <i>three</i>
Loggerheads be." The sign having been renovated, the old painting is
obliterated: but whatever may have replaced it, <i>the old name</i>, the
Loggerheads, most probably is still used; and inasmuch as the aspect of
the house was venerable when I first remember it, we may, without a
violent stretch of imagination, carry back the use of the
above-described conceit of the three loggerheads, as an alehouse sign,
at least a considerable portion of the period intervening between our
time and that of Shakspeare. Whether more examples, besides that at
Tonbridge, of this sign may still exist, is unknown, but I do not
recollect seeing a second in any part of the kingdom.<a id="Page_339"></a> <span class="pagenum">[339]</span> Possibly
others might be discovered, though they cannot be common; and perhaps
the suggestion will be admitted, that the above-mentioned little
public-house is not altogether unworthy of consideration, as assisting,
in however slight a degree, in illustrating the language of our great
national dramatist.</p>

<h3>
<span>COWLEY'S PROSE WORKS.</span>
</h3>

<p>As Cowley's name has been brought before the public in the disquisition
on his monument by M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. H. C<span class="smcap lowercase">AMPKIN</span> ("N. &amp; Q." Vol. v., pp. 267-8.), may I
be allowed, now that his character and merits are revived, to direct
attention to his prose works in preference to his poetical; although, as
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">AMPKIN</span> remarks, "his beautiful lyrics in praise of a country life
will always keep his name before us."</p>

<p>Miss Mitford, in her recent publication, <i>Recollections of a Literary
Life</i>, has done good service to Cowley's character, and her criticisms
will doubtless direct attention, as they have done to the septuagenarian
who is now writing, to a <i>re-perusal</i> of his prose works. With my
school-fellow Charles Lamb, and his sister, Cowley's prose essays were
always especial favourites, and were esteemed by them as some of the
best specimens of the "well of English undefiled." A tyro in literature
could not, I am persuaded, form a better style of composition, than by
taking Cowley's prose essays for his model. I consider the prose
writings both of Cowley and Dryden master-pieces. "Praised in his day as
a great poet, the head of the school of poets called metaphysical,
Cowley will now be chiefly known," says Miss Mitford, "by those prose
essays, all too short and all too few, which, whether for thought or for
expression, have rarely been excelled by any writer in any language.
They are eminently distinguished for the grace, the finish, and the
clearness which his verse too often wants." "His thoughts," also says
Dr. Johnson, "are natural; and his style has a smooth and placid
equability, <i>which has never yet obtained its due commendation</i>."</p>

<p>As the columns of "N. &amp; Q." do not admit of long quotations, I would
respectfully direct attention to the beautiful essays, "Of Obscurity,"
"The Garden," "Of Solitude," and "Of Liberty." Southey and Cobbett, as
writers of pure English, are, in my opinion, the only two modern authors
who can be compared with Cowley.</p>

<h3>
<span>NOTE ON COLERIDGE'S CHRISTABEL.</span>
</h3>

<p>Should the English language ever become after the lapse of years a dead
language, it is a curious question, whether the works of our poets and
prose writers would present such difficulties to students at that remote
period, as the pages of the Greek and Roman authors present to
ourselves. Our text, it is to be hoped, would not prove so corrupt as
theirs, or afford so much scope to the ingenuity of scholars; but the
lax phraseology now in vogue would amply supply its place. As to
downright inherent obscurity, I think it is not at all clear that we are
a whit behind the ancients. More than one, even of our living poets,
would require a Delphin interpretation. As a fair sample of what English
poetry is able to offer in the way of difficulty, I would refer to the
"conclusion" of Coleridge's unfinished poem of Christabel.</p>

<p>The few lines, of which this conclusion consists, form an unquestionably
difficult passage. How many persons, and they of no mean abilities, read
it over and over again, and, after all, confess they can make nothing of
it! How many are there, who have come to regard it in the light of a
quaint enigma, and "give it up!" The passage certainly seems to possess
one property of the enigma, inasmuch as it requires a key to elucidate
it; but, as soon as this is obtained it becomes not only perfectly
plain, but, I think, forces an acknowledgment from the reader, that it
could hardly have been more clearly or more justly expressed.</p>

<p>To say that this conclusion is the most beautiful and the most valuable
portion of the poem of Christabel, may appear to savour a little of
extravagance; still, I cannot but think that it is, and that the author
intended to convey by it far more than is usually contained in the
common-place "moral." In support of this opinion I will briefly discuss
these two-and-twenty lines.</p>

<p>Of the first six lines I will only remark, where shall we find, in the
whole range of English poetry, a more exquisite picture than is here
contained in this small compass?</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"A little child, a limber elf,</p>
      <p>Singing, dancing to itself,</p>
      <p>A fairy thing with red round cheeks,</p>
      <p><i>That always finds, and never seeks</i>,</p>
      <p>Makes such a vision to the sight,</p>
      <p>As fills a father's eyes with light."</p>

</div>

<p>The poet then proceeds to unite in a manner true in nature and in fact,
yet equally strange and startling, two opposite and contending feelings:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p> "And pleasures flow in so thick and fast</p>
      <p>Upon his heart, that he at last</p>
      <p>Must needs express his love's excess,</p>
      <p> With words of unmeant bitterness."</p>

</div>

<p>The habit, if it may be so called, alluded to in these lines, must be
more or less familiar to most persons as an anomaly in our nature; the
habit, I mean, ridiculous as it may appear, of applying evil, though
"unmeant" names to children in a transport of affection. This is a trait
in the human character which, slight, and faint, and trifling as
it<a id="Page_340"></a> <span class="pagenum">[340]</span> may seem, the acute mind of Coleridge has seized, and
analysed, and exhibited in its legitimate development. Whether the
propensity, thus delicately described, be really innocent in itself, or
whether it be only the
 <span title="[Greek: parekbasis]">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#954;&#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>, or excess, which the poet
held to be the guilty state, it is hardly worth while stopping to
inquire; still we cannot avoid his own startling suggestion,</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p> "What, if in a world of sin</p>
      <p>(O sorrow and shame should this be true!)</p>
      <p>Such giddiness of heart and brain"</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">springs generally from some evil source, implies the existence of some
evil principle. Familiar as this habit, this instance of "giddiness of
heart and brain," is to most of us, I am not aware that it has ever been
expressed in poetry, or even in prose, by any other writer; if so, this
passage is a rarity, similar to those four stanzas in Gray's Elegy,
beginning, "Yet e'en these bones," &amp;c., of which Dr. Johnson says, "they
are to me original; I have never seen the notions in any other place;
yet he that reads them here persuades himself that he has always felt
them."</p>

<p>The author then endeavours to offer some explanation of this phenomenon,
and carries out the germ of ill to its full extent, as exemplified in
Sir Leoline:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Perhaps 'tis pretty to force together</p>
     <p> Thoughts so all unlike each other;</p>
     <p> To mutter and mock a broken charm,</p>
      <p>To dally with wrong that does no harm;</p>
      <p>Perhaps 'tis tender too and pretty,</p>
      <p><i>At each wild word to feel within</i></p>
      <p><i>A sweet recoil of love and pity</i>."</p>

</div>

<p>It appears to me that the third line in this passage, from its being
introduced too early (if I may venture to say so), on this account
unnecessarily increases the difficulty; it occurs before the idea has
been sufficiently developed; while it belongs rather to the result of
this evil leaven than to the explanation of it, with which the poet is
here engaged. The "charm" to which he alludes is, of course, the tie
that binds us to the object of affection, and which forbids us to speak
any but words of love and tenderness.</p>

<p>The poet, then, from the aspect of this strange anomaly, as exemplified
in Sir Leoline, is forced to the following conclusion:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "And what, if in a world of sin</p>
     <p> (O sorrow and shame should this be true!)</p>
     <p> Such giddiness of heart and brain</p>
      <p>Comes seldom save from rage and pain,</p>
     <p> So talks as it's most used to do."</p>

</div>

<p>If we turn now to the last two paragraphs of the poem, we find all this
illustrated; in these two paragraphs the poet has</p>

<div class="poem">

                    <p class="i5">"Forced together</p>
    <p>  Thoughts so all unlike each other."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">In the former are enumerated all those memorials which could move the
Baron to "love and pity;" in the latter we are told of the "rage and
pain" of his heart; and on this strange union the poet soliloquises in
the conclusion.</p>

<p>A full discussion of this subject would be perhaps unsuited to the pages
of "N. &amp; Q.;" for, various as are the subjects to which they are open,
ethics can hardly be reckoned one of them. I will conclude, therefore,
with the following suggestion, viz. that the delicacy, the acuteness,
and the truth evinced in this last scene of Christabel and its
conclusion, tell of a deeper mind than has, perhaps, fallen to the lot
of any English poet since the days of William Shakspeare.</p>

<h3>
<span>CONVERTIBILITY OF THE WORDS "GRIN" AND "GIN".</span>
</h3>


<p>Will some more learned readers than your present querist be so good as
to tell us how it came to pass that the word <i>grin</i> became changed in
our modern Bibles for <i>gin</i> (sometimes spelled <i>ginn</i>), with which it
would seem there can be no cognation? In the sense of a trap or snare
<i>grin</i> occurs in Job xviii. 9., Ps. cxl. 5., and Ps. cxli. 9., in two
Bibles which I have, viz., one "printed at London by Robert Barker,
printer to the King's most excellent Majestie, 1640," and the other
"printed by John Hayes, printer to the University of Cambridge, 1677."</p>

<p>In Cruden's <i>Concordance</i>, 1737, 1761, and 1769, it is given as <i>grin</i>
in these instances; neither in the modern editions of that valuable book
have they noticed the word <i>gin</i> as now used in the said three texts
which would indicate that it is only within some eighty years, at any
rate, that the change was adopted by the king's printer, and Oxford and
Cambridge. Singularly enough, in these old editions of 1640 and 1677,
while <i>grin</i> is used in Job and Psalms, <i>gin</i> is given in the side-note
of Job xl. 24., in the text of Isa. viii. 14., and Amos iii. 5.</p>

<p>Now to <i>grin</i> (from the Saxon <span class="strong1 bla">grinian</span>) means, according to
philologists, to show the teeth set together; the act of closing the
teeth; so that we may suppose an allusion to the barbarous instrument
called a <i>man-trap</i>, unless the idea is negatived by the side-note Job
xl. 24., on the impossibility of boring Behemoth's nose with a <i>gin</i>,
which would hardly be the word adopted to convey the idea of boring; an
awl or gimlet better suiting the conditions of the case. Some
commentators read <i>ring</i>&mdash;this may be illustrated by the ring we see
even now frequently in the noses of our bulls. Be this as it may, the
reasonable conjecture is, that the same word, conveying the same
meaning, is appropriate in all the six places quoted.<a id="Page_341"></a> <span class="pagenum">[341]</span></p>

<p>It is therefore asked, 1. Why, in the sacred volume, a century ago it
should have been spelled <i>grin</i> in the three first-mentioned passages,
and <i>gin</i> in the three others? and 2. Why it should have been altered in
the three first-quoted verses from <i>grin</i> to <i>gin</i>? In short, if they
are cognate words (which the separate use of them in various editions
formerly seems to render doubtful), what advantage resulted from
changing the word which more familiarly explains itself by the action of
the teeth for a much less forcible term?</p>

<span>FOLK LORE.</span>
</h3>


<h4>
<span><i>Game Feathers.</i></span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;I do not see that any of your numerous correspondents
have mentioned the common belief among the poor in this county (Sussex),
that a person cannot die if his bed is stuffed with <i>game feathers</i>. A
friend of mine a little time back was talking to a labourer on the
absurdity of such a belief; but he failed to convince the good man, who,
as a <i>proof</i> of the correctness of his belief brought forward the case
of a poor man who had lately died after a lingering illness. "Look at
poor Muster S&mdash;&mdash;, how hard he were a dying; poor soul, he could not die
ony way, till neighbour Puttick found out how it wer,&mdash;'Muster S&mdash;&mdash;,'
says he, 'ye be lying on geame feathers, mon, surely;' and so he wer. So
we took'n out o'bed, and laid'n on the floore, and he <i>pretty soon died
then</i>!"</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Isle of Man Folk Lore.</i></span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;A young person from Castletown tells me as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>A woman walking over Barrule met two fairy armies going to battle, which
was to begin on the ringing of a bell; she pulled the bell, and in
consequence both armies attacked her, and kept her prisoner for three
years, when she escaped.</p>

<p>A little girl, walking over a bridge, was offered by three little men
(one after the other) a farthing, which she persevered in refusing;
knowing that, if accepted, she would have been carried off.</p>

<p>A labouring man, passing by a house which is said to be haunted by
soldiers, saw a soldier from Castletown sitting on a stile; and, on
going up to tell him that the bugle had sounded, the soldier vanished
into air, and the man saw a ball of fire before him all the way home.</p>

<p>A white lady walked through a room one evening when the doors were
bolted and barred, and could not be found anywhere; a murder was once
committed in a room of this house, and, although the boards have been
moved, blood will come again.</p>

<p>At Peel, a witch with a basin of water said that the herring fleet would
never return; every ship was lost, and she was put in a barrel with
spikes, and rolled down the hill, the grass never having grown since;
"and I saw the mark all down."</p>

<p>Women are turned into hares, and can only be shot with a silver
sixpence.</p>

<p>A white lady was seen every night after dark; and one night, when all
were in bed, a servant heard a knock at the door, put her head out of
window, and saw a little doll hop round the house and knock three times;
she was so frightened that she could not get her head in, till others
pulled her. The house was then suddenly illuminated, and, when quite
dark again, the bed-clothes pulled off.</p>

<p>The fairies are seen to hop from trees: a man took one home for a doll,
and became very ill; but on the advice of a woman, he returned it where
found, and then quite recovered.</p>

<p>Fairies change children; a woman had one for eighteen years, and could
not make it walk or speak. A woman, shearing corn, laid her child down;
a man saw a fairy come and change it: the fairy-child screamed, and the
woman, going to take it up, was prevented by the man. The fairy seeing
that no one touched it, returned the woman's child.</p>

<p>People are pulled off horses by black dogs. Three stone coffins were
lately dug up, and the place not since haunted.</p>

<p>Our woman servant told me that her father (who used to drink), and
others, chased a black dog, which kept howling and screaming round the
town, up as far as the gallows post; but did not dare to go beyond, and
came back as fast as they could.</p>

<p>A tradesman told me that lying on a sofa at an inn, a white lady
whispered and told him where some money was to be found; he fell off the
sofa, was ill for six months, and has been lame ever since. The owner of
the house would give him half if he tells; but he will not tell, or the
white lady would haunt him.</p>

<p>They say that fairies are the fallen angels.</p>

<p>&mdash;Among the interesting communications
relating to monuments and trees, I see no mention made of some fine
effigies of the De la Beche family, in an old church near which are the
largest yew-trees I ever saw,<a id="Page_342"></a> <span class="pagenum">[342]</span> on the edge of the Downs, about
four miles above the road which runs from Reading in Berkshire to

<h4>
<span><i>Cousinship.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;There appear to be various ways of computing
relationship. The following is the mode which I have usually adopted,
and I should be glad to know whether or not it is strictly correct:</p>

<table class="table1" summary="Cousinship">
<tr><td class="colspan2 tdcenter">James</td></tr>
<tr><td class="colspan2 tdcenter">|</td></tr>
<tr><td class="colspan2 tdcenter">____________</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdleft"> John</td> <td class="tdleft">William</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdleft">&nbsp;&nbsp;|</td> <td class="tdleft">&nbsp;&nbsp;|</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdleft">&nbsp;&nbsp;|</td> <td class="tdleft">&nbsp;&nbsp;|</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdleft"> Edward</td> <td class="tdleft">Robert</td></tr>
</table>


<p>In the above pedigree Thomas and Henry are <i>second</i> cousins; Edward and
Robert <i>third</i> cousins; and so on. If I am asked what relation Henry is
to David, I reply they are <i>first</i> and <i>second</i> cousins; or else I
<i>invert</i> the answer, and say that David is Henry's <i>first</i> cousin once
removed: on the principle of making the relationship as near as possible
by stating the degree of the older ascendant: in other words, I do not
say that Henry is David's <i>second</i> cousin once removed. In like manner,
David and Robert are <i>first</i> and <i>third</i> cousins; or David is Robert's
<i>first</i> cousin twice removed.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Borrowing Days.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In a communication in "N. &amp; Q." (Vol. v., p. 278.)
regarding Sir Alexander Cumming, there occurs the following statement:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "The last three days of March are called the 'Borrowing Days' in
   Scotland, on account of their being generally attended with very
   blustering weather, which inclines people to say that they would
   wish to <i>borrow</i> three days from the month of April in exchange
   for those last three days of the month of March."</p>

<p>I remember to have heard, when a child, in the north of Ireland, a far
more poetical, if not a more rational, explanation of what is
undoubtedly a very common interchange of character between March and
April, for a few successive days towards the close of the former, and
commencement of the latter, month. "Give me (says March) three days of
warmth and sunshine for my poor young lambs whilst they are yet too
tender to bear the roughness of my wind and rain, and you shall have
them repaid when the wool is grown." An attentive observer of the
weather will seldom find the recurrence of this accommodation loan to
fail. This day (the 24th) and the two last days have been of a
temperature very unusual so early in the year, and I have little doubt
that before the 1st of May there will be a <i>per contr√†</i> of three
successive days of cold and bluster carried to the <i>credit</i> side of
April's account with √Üolus and Co.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Junius and the Quarterly Review.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The writer in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>
who has attributed the <i>Letters of Junius</i> to Thomas Lyttelton, seems to
have overlooked that passage in the <i>Lyttelton Letters</i> in which the
writer confesses his deficiency in the <i>principal</i> "rhetorical figure,"
which at once rendered "the style of Junius" so popular:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "<i>Irony</i> is not my talent, and B&mdash;&mdash; says I have too much
   impudence to make use of it. It is a fine rhetorical figure; and
   if there were a chance of attaining the manner in which Junius
   has employed it, its cultivation will be worth my
   attention."</p>

<p class="author1"><i>Letter 36.</i> p. 131.</p>

<p>In my researches to "set this question at rest," I have found the
<i>Discoverers of Junius</i> invariably inclined to withhold some fact or
circumstance, which, if published with the <i>proofs</i>, must have
overthrown their hypotheses. This may be good policy in an advocate
pleading before a jury, or in an orator addressing a popular assembly,
where an object may be attained by "making out a good case." On the
question of <i>Junius</i> it is not only disingenuous, but highly
reprehensible, since it proves that the writer thinks more of gratifying
his own vanity, than in satisfying the public.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Handwriting.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In my last communication (Vol. v., p. 235.), in
consecutive lines, <i>when</i> was printed <i>where</i>, and <i>second</i> was printed
<i>record</i>. This is not wholly the printer's fault: in the common current
hands, <i>n</i> and <i>re</i> are much alike; and <i>n</i> and <i>r</i>, <i>s</i> and <i>r</i>, are
like enough to cause mistake. I have more than once got as far as a
second proof, containing what might, if it had been printed, have been
interpreted as a reflection on the dimensions of the clergy, which was
far from my intention; namely, allusion to the area of a circular
<i>rector</i>, in which the first <i>r</i> should have been <i>s</i>. What I want to
make a note on, is this: no <i>current</i> hand is taught at schools: the
so-called<a id="Page_343"></a> <span class="pagenum">[343]</span> <i>small</i> hand is nothing but the larger hand written
smaller. If any one would publish some specimens of current hand, in
which all the letters are perfectly distinguishable from each other, he
would do good service. And the (?) might go the length of a woodcut
(which imitates writing better than copper): for no persons write so
badly as writers. The task should not be undertaken by a writing-master:
for there are few who will go through thick and thin in their
calligraphy. What is wanted is a good <i>skewer-hand</i>, in which there are
none of those upstrokes and downstrokes which, in former days, used to
subject boys to certain other upstrokes and downstrokes, of which it can
only be said that the former were more bearable than the latter.</p>

<h3>
<span>SALMON FISHERIES.</span>
</h3>

<p>Grievous complaints are now making of the scarcity of salmon, and
consequently of the depressed state of the salmon fisheries, both in
Scotland and Ireland. As the statistics of the produce of the principal
rivers of those countries for some years past are known, it would be
curious to contrast their returns in the present century with any
accounts which may exist of their produce in former times.</p>

<p>For example, the Earl of Strafford wrote, in 1638, that the fishery at
Derry produced to the crown that year 240 tons of salmon, which sold at
15<i>l.</i> per ton. In 1845 the seven years average of the Foyle (Derry) was
140 tons, and the price ranged at about 100<i>l.</i> per ton. Pennant states
that as much as 320 tons were taken in the Bann in 1760; and Stanihurst,
writing about the year 1584, declares that the fishermen of Lough Neagh,
and of the "noble northerne river, the Banne, complain more often for
bursting of their nets with the over great take of fish, than for anie
want," so that the Irish grievance of that day lay in the very glut of
the commodity.</p>

<p>The famous "salmon-leap" at Ballyshannon, on the Erne, was formerly very
productive. It belonged to the O'Donels, Lords of Tyrconnel. Sir George
Carew, in a MS. pedigree of that family, observes that</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"O'Donell is the best lorde of fishe in Ireland, and exchangeth
   fishe allwayes with foreign merchants for wyne, by which his call
   in other countryes the kinge of fishe."</p>

<p>In Roman Catholic times our national salmon fisheries were of much
value, for they supplied an article of food which was necessary for fast
days; there are, accordingly, many ancient acts of parliament in the
statute books for the preservation of the salmon, and still more in the
Scotch statutes, in one of which, indeed, a jubilee was ordained for the
benefit of the finny tribe, by making it penal to take any salmon for
the space of three years. Not only did private and religious houses rely
upon a supply of salted fish for fast days, and for the winter's
consumption, but armies at that time could not be marched or subsisted
without them. There is in Rymer an order of Edward II. to provide 3000
dried salmon for this very purpose.</p>

<p>All our mouths water at hearing of "kippered salmon," especially at
breakfast-time; but it seems from old Izaak Walton's use of the word
that the origin of the delicacy is not the very best, for he uses the
word as expressive of a "sprat," or spawned cock-salmon, <i>out of
season</i>, and it is verily to be believed that the dainty is produced by
preserving the fish when in a state that it could not be eaten if fresh.</p>

<p>Travellers in the colder latitudes of the new and old world, agree in
representing the rivers of those countries as literally swarming with
noble salmon. The increase of man, and the advances of civilisation,
have led to the decrease of salmon in the British Islands, and this fish
will probably, in a century or so more, rank among other exterminated
animals, as the bustard, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Any of your readers would oblige me by reference to authorities in which
statements may be found as to the ancient productiveness of the salmon
fisheries of Great Britain and Ireland; in fact, to any information or
curious details on the subject.</p>

<h3>
<span>THOMAS CRAWFURD.</span>

<p>Can any of your readers inform me when Mr. Thomas Crawfurd was the
Professor of Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh? In a <i>Scotch
Peerage</i>, by Mr. George Crawfurd, published in 1716, there is a Latin
epigram by him on the armorial bearings of the Crawfurds of Kilbirny in
Ayrshire, one of whom was created Viscount Garnock by Queen Anne, in the
second year of her reign. The description of the armorial bearings is as
follows in the same peerage, under the head Crawfurd, Viscount of
Garnock&mdash;</p>

Corinth. The Abb√© has left the Roman Church, and joined the branch of
Mr. Henry Drummond's Church in France, and is the editor of <i>Le Recueil
Catholique</i>, to advocate the cause of the new church. The passage to
which I refer is in the October Number, p. 208., and is given as a proof
of his theory: "L'Apostolat supplant√©, absorb√© par l'Episcopat;" this
first order of ministry in the Christian Church having been in abeyance,
till it was revived in the person of Mr. Drummond and the other eleven
apostles of that Church! In Mant and D'Oyley's Bible it is said that
Diotrophes is unknown; and Grotius and Doddridge entertain different

<p>&mdash;There is a carved oak chimney-piece
in my possession, of the time of James I., from a mansion at
Newcastle-upon-Tyne occupied as the Turk's Head Inn, and taken down
about fifteen years ago. In the central compartment is a shield, but the
crest is wanting. The quarterings are three stags' heads, and checky;
and as the motto has puzzled wiser heads than mine, I beg leave to
produce it. One or two of the letters are doubtful, but there is no
omission:</p>

      <p class="center">    "VITATRANOVULAESTOLIM."</p>

Wilkie's picture of "The Blind Fiddler." I believe he painted as many as
four, if not more, copies of the original, and that the first picture
was finished by him in the year 1807; that in the National Gallery is
dated, as I am informed, 1808. What I wish to ascertain is, the real

<h4>
<span><i>Lode.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;It seems to be a provincial word, according to Forby, and means
"an artificial water-course," from A.-S. <i>lodian</i>, <i>haurire</i>; he also
adduces the instance I have named, and also a water-course in Fincham,
called in old writings "the Lode ditch." It would be interesting to know
if it is used elsewhere than in Norfolk, and it may be Suffolk; but, at
all events, I should much like to come at the real meaning.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Ballad quoted by Sir Walter Scott.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Effie Deans, in the <i>Heart of
Mid-Lothian</i>, sings this stanza of a ballad:</p>

<div class="poem">

   <p class="noindent">"The elfin knight sate on the brae,</p>
       <p> The broom grows bonnie, the broom grows fair,</p>
 <p class="noindent">And by there cam' lilting a lady so gay,</p>
        <p>And we daurna' gang down to the broom nae mair."</p>

</div>

<p>There is a traditional ballad, very similar, of which the following is
the only stanza preserved:</p>

<div class="poem">

  <p class="noindent">"Ae kings dochter said to anither,</p>
        <p>Broom blooms bonnie, an' grows sae fair,</p>
  <p class="noindent">We'll gae ride like sister and brither,</p>
        <p>But we'll never gae down to the broom nae mair."</p>

</div>

<p>Sir Walter Scott delighted in preserving scraps of old ballads; and
perhaps the two fragments above quoted may be part and parcel of the
same original. Some friend in the "north countrie" may perhaps settle
this point.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Moveable Organs and Pulpits.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;In looking over a small pamphlet,
entitled <i>The Temple Church, an Account of its Restoration and Repairs</i>,
by William Burge, Esq. (8vo. 1843, Pickering), I met with the following
passage, which serves me for a peg on which to hang a Query:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "Mr Etty justly observes that 'in St. Peter's at the present day,
   the organ is a very small one comparatively to the building, and
   is wheeled about, like the ancient pulpits, to different parts of
   the church!'"&mdash;P. 34.</p>

<p>Are movable organs common in Italy or elsewhere? With regard to pulpits,
the chapel of King's College, Cambridge, has two at the present time,
placed in one of the small chapels on the north side. They are moved
into the choir when required. Besides these, the neighbouring church at
Grantchester has a large pulpit, which, tradition says, also once
belonged to the same noble edifice. Can any of your correspondents
mention other examples of churches or chapels so well supplied?</p>

on the derivation of the name of a village, which in early records is
spelt "Chalwoldesbury," "Chelwardesbury," "Chilwardesbury,"
"Chedwoldesby," &amp;c. It is partly on the site of a British or Danish
encampment, in a good state of preservation. The soil is chalky, and the
country for some short distance round may have been open, but more
probably the woods closely surrounded the camp. These particulars may
assist in arriving at the derivation of the name, now corrupted into
Cholesbury.</p>

antiquities. He was one of the original members of the Roxburghe Club,
established nearly forty years ago, and had devoted a long life to his
favourite pursuits. Having been a native of Gloucestershire, he felt a
particular interest in everything which regarded that county, and had in
his lifetime collected a great mass of materials for the elucidation of
its history, antiquities, &amp;c., in every respect. It is understood that
an ample catalogue (<i>raisonn√©</i> perhaps) was printed under his direction
for circulation among his particular friends, giving great evidence of
his assiduity and talents, and of the value of the collection.
Participating to a great extent the interest which actuated Mr. Phelps
to ascertain a local knowledge of Gloucestershire, I should feel obliged

parish church of Croydon; but in 1637 many clergymen were deprived of
their livings for not complying with the royal ordinance. In that year,
at least, Lawrence Snelling, Rector of Paul's Cray, was for that offence

burnt by the common hangman in Cheapside and other usual places. The
Sheriffs of London and Middlesex were required "to assist effectually"
in the execution of the order; and all persons were required forthwith
to deliver up all copies to the sheriff. The 10th of May was the day

<h3>
<span>MEANING OF GROOM.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 57.)</span>
</h3>

<p>Several of the recent articles of the "N. &amp; Q." having had relation to
the word <i>groom</i>, I may be allowed to submit to you a most ludicrous
misconception of the duties attributed by our continental neighbours to
our court-office of "Groom of the Stole," which struck me some years
ago. One of the most laborious, and, from his extensive historical
knowledge, one of the most competent editors of French memoirs, is M. F.
Barri√®re, whose introductory discourses have been used so frequently by
the writers on French subjects in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, though not
always with frank avowal of the obligation. In 1828 he published <i>Les
M√©moires du Comte de Brienne</i>, a distinguished public man during the
minority and early reign of Louis XIV., and there, at p. 372. of the
second volume, referring to Brienne's father's <i>M√©moires</i>, tome i. p.
407. (Amsterdam, 1719, 8vo.), produces the following singular
misapprehension of our habits and language. In 1624 the elder of these
noblemen, it seems, was deputed by Louis XIII. to adjust the preparatory
arrangements of our Charles I.'s marriage with Henrietta Maria, the
French monarch's sister, who, it was stipulated, should be attended
equally by French and English ladies. Among the former are named the
Duchess of Chevreuse, the Mar√©chale de Th√©mines (wife of the Marshal),
and Madame de Saint-Georges, who had been the princess's governess and
lady of honour,&mdash;a title unknown, it is said, at the English court, but
for which the<a id="Page_348"></a> <span class="pagenum">[348]</span> Duke of Buckingham, the representative of Charles,
proposed as an equivalent, that of Groom of the <i>Stool</i> (sic) "qui
revient assez bien √† ce qu'on appelerait dans notre langue, le
gentilhomme, ou la dame de <i>la chaise-perc√©e</i>. Cette charge est tr√®s
consid√©rable; elle fait jouir de tr√®s grands privil√®ges," &amp;c. A natural
expression of surprise follows this portraiture of a high and regular
functionary, whose attributes not even majesty could ennoble or strip of
indignity. The transposition of the name and duties of Groom of the
Stole has caused this most ridiculous blunder&mdash;a double one, indeed, for
the office does not belong to female majesty, though it may, as of
course at present, form part of a royal consort's household. The living
editor of De Brienne, who dwells on these "√©tranges usages de nos
voisins d'outremer," tells us, and it is confirmed by De Brienne
himself, that this nobleman felt proud and honoured at the familiarity
and confidence of Louis XIV., who often conferred with him on state
affairs, enthroned "sur sa chaise-perc√©e." The Duchess of Burgundy,
mother of Louis XV., it is known, never hesitated to administer to
herself a relieving remedy, not to be pronounced by name in English
society, in presence of Louis XIV. and his attendant courtiers; so that
these violations of decorum, falsely imputed to our court, were of
historical truth at Versailles.</p>

<p>May not <i>groom</i> be the <i>literal</i> English of the French <i>√©cuyer</i>, and
have in the places quoted the same meaning as <i>esquire</i>, which is
evidently the Anglicised French?</p>

<h3>
<span>BALLAD OF LORD DELAWARE.<br />
(Vol. ii., pp. 104. 158.; Vol. v., p. 243.)</span>
</h3>


<p>As I have reason to believe that several of your readers are interested
in this old ballad, I send you an exact transcript of the oral version
contained in Mr. Lyle's (not <i>Lyte's</i>, as incorrectly printed in my
former communication) now rare little volume.</p>

<p>Your correspondent C. W. G. thinks that it relates to some transaction
much later than 1622; and possibly he may be right. It may be as well,
however, to mention that Mr. J. H. Dixon, who inserted the ballad in his
<i>Ancient Poems, Ballads, and Songs of the Peasantry of England</i> (Percy
Society, No. LXII.), thinks otherwise, and, indeed, claims for it an
antiquity as high as the reign of Edward III., <span class="smaller">A.D</span>. 1377. He suggests
that for De la Ware we should read De la Mare, and believes Sir Thomas
De la Mare, Speaker of the House of Commons, to have been the hero. Mr.
Dixon says:</p>

<p>   "All historians are agreed in representing him as a person using
   'great freedom of speech,' and which, indeed, he carried to such
   an extent as to endanger his personal liberty. As bearing
   somewhat upon the subject of the ballad, it may be observed that
   De la Mare was a great advocate of popular rights, and
   particularly protested against the inhabitants of England being
   subject to 'purveyance;' asserting that 'if the royal revenue was
   faithfully administered, there could be no necessity for laying
   burdens on the people.'"</p>

<p>The title of the "Welsh lord, the brave Duke of Devonshire," offers some
opposition to Mr. Dixon's hypothesis, as no <i>Duke</i> of Devonshire was
created before 1694; but, as Sir Walter Scott observed, upon a friend
pointing out an inaccuracy in his "Bonnets of bonnie Dundee," "We cannot
always be particular in a ballad." Possibly the name of some other
country or place should be substituted for that of "Devonshire." Indeed
I remember, some ten years ago, hearing a version of this ballad sung at
a village in Staffordshire, where the "minstrel" (for he was a true
descendant of the wandering tribe) used <i>Hereford</i> in the place of
Devonshire.</p>

<p>There is an old ballad in Deloney's <i>Garland of Good Will</i>, upon the
quarrel between the two Dukes of Hereford and Norfolk, in the reign of
Richard II. See Hume's <i>Hist. of Eng.</i>, chap. xvii.,
 <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1398, for a
full account of the transaction. There seems to be some "relationship"
between this "combat" and that of the Lord Delaware. At any rate, the
following ballad smacks wonderfully (allowing for the march of time, and
Mr. Lyle's "smoothing down") of the style of the "ballading
silk-weaver," and his cotemporary poetasters.</p>

<p>"LORD DELAWARE.</p>

<div class="stanza">

      <p>"In the Parliament House, a great rout has been there,</p>

<div class="stanza">

     <p> "What's your boon, says the King, now let me understand?</p>
     <p> It's, give me all the poor men we've starving in this land;</p>
      <p>And without delay, I'll hie me to Lincolnshire,</p>
    <p>  To sow hemp seed and flax seed, and hang them all there.</p>

</div>
<div class="stanza">

<p>"For with hempen cord it's better to stop each poor man's breath,</p>
      <p>Than with famine you should see your subjects starve to death.</p>
     <p> Up starts a Dutch Lord, who to Delaware did say,</p>

 <div class="stanza">

 <p>"Thou deservest to be stabb'd, and the dogs have thine ears,</p>

      <p>"Then he sprang from the stage, to a soldier in the ring,</p>

      <p>Even more than this I'd venture, for young Lord Delaware.</p>

<h3>
<span>FAMILY LIKENESSES.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 260.)</span>
</h3>


<p>To most persons the discovery by V<span class="smcap lowercase">OKAROS</span> of a family likeness existing
between the face on the brass of the Abbess of Elstow, and the portrait
of the Marquis of Bristol, after a lapse of three centuries, would
probably seem moderately far-fetched; but when this is adduced as
"valuable evidence on the disputed point, whether portraits were
attempted in sepulchral brasses," a very great demand indeed is made
upon our credulity. I have not the means now of referring to the works
of Fisher and Rokewode; but I have before me a rubbing of the Elstow
brass. Any person tolerably familiar with the subject will at once see
that the face of the lady is identical with that which is repeatedly to
be found on numerous brass effigies of persons of both sexes at the
beginning of the sixteenth century; in fact, it is not very dissimilar
to that of the fellow brass of the Abbot at Dorchester, Oxon. If,
therefore, we might judge by the likeness, very many brazen-faced gentry
of olden time might claim the honour of being ancestors of the noble
lord. And so far from its being a disputed point, whether the faces on
brasses are attempted likenesses, no one, I think, who has at all
studied our monumental brasses, can fail to have come to the conclusion
that they were <i>not</i> intended to be portraits. The great proof of this
lies in the obvious similarity in the faces of cotemporary figures which
have been produced by the same artists, who, probably from their
residing in London, and perhaps in a few other places, very rarely had
an opportunity of seeing the persons to be commemorated. The
instructions forwarded to the engravers would seem to have been confined
to the inscription and other details, chiefly the costume, at least if
we may judge from the large brasses at Digswell, Herts, and other
similar figures. The ready adoption of unaltered palimpsest effigies may
also be cited as an additional proof of the likeness being entirely a
matter of indifference; and it is not improbable that many brasses were
kept ready made, half-length figures of priests for instance; and files
of children, all bearing a strong family likeness, may have been
engraved, ready to be cut off on the shortest notice, and laid down at
so much per foot. The only approach towards a likeness, if it may be
termed such, seems to be the distinction between youth and age, and even
that was almost wholly neglected in the fifteenth and earlier half of
the sixteenth centuries. The foregoing remarks apply chiefly to brasses
before the latter end of the sixteenth century; after that period
portraits were evidently not unfrequently attempted. Very rare
instances, however, before this time, <i>may</i> be found. I may specify the
effigy of Nich. Canteys, 1431, Margate, Kent.</p>

<p>Mr. Doyle, in his able painting of <i>Caxton submitting his proof-sheet to
Abbot Estney</i> (noticed in "N. &amp; Q." No. 54. p. 398.) has taken the
likeness of the Abbot from his brass in Westminster Abbey, which is, I
suppose, as good a likeness of the original as any other that can be
found; but the members of Queen's College, Oxford, have not been so
fortunate. Several years ago, while hunting up a likeness of their
founder (Robt. Egglesfield, 1340), they stumbled upon an old brass in
the College Chapel, from which a painting and engraving was made
purporting to be that of the founder. Recent researches have
unfortunately fatally dispelled this illusion, as the effigy<a id="Page_350"></a> <span class="pagenum">[350]</span> in
question undoubtedly commemorates Dr. Robt. Langton, who deceased 1518.</p>

<h3>
<span>EARL OF ERROLL.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 297.)</span>
</h3>


<p>According to Burke's <i>Peerage</i> for 1850, the present Lord Erroll is "the
twenty-second High Constable of Scotland; and as such is, by birth, the
first subject in Scotland after the blood-royal, having a right to take
place of every hereditary honour, which was granted to his lordship's
father on the visit of George IV. to North Britain" (in 1822).</p>

<p>In a small treatise, <i>De Jure Prelationis Nobilium Scoti√¶</i>, printed by
the Bannatyne Club in 1827, from a manuscript in the Advocates' Library,
with a preface and numerous additions by Sir Alexander Seton, Lord
Pitmedden, I find the following remark, under the head of "Comes de
Erroll":&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "The Earle of Erroll claims precedency of all the nobilitie of
   Scotland nixt to the Chancellour, though of ane ancienter
   creation than himself, be vertue of his office of Constabulary,
   of the which that precedency is a priviledge; and to instruct
   that it is a priviledge, he produces a Report of a Commission
   that was granted be the King under the Great Seal anno 1631, to
   take tryall of the priviledges of the Constable; which Report, in
   the second article thereof, bears that the precedency is due to
   the Constable next to the Chancellor, <i>but he has never been in
   possession of it, but only takes place by his antiquity as
   Earle</i>."</p>


<p>The report here referred to is given in Nisbet's <i>Heraldry</i>, vol. ii. p.
67. In the eighth chapter of Sir George Mackenzie's treatise on
"Precedency" (p. 534. of the second volume of his works), your
correspondent will find some interesting information regarding the
ancient office of High Constable. In the course of his remarks the
learned author says:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">   "Next to these (<i>i.e.</i> the Chancellor, Justice-General,
   Chamberlain, High Steward, Panetarius, and Buttelarius) are
   named, in the laws of King Malcolm Canmore (1057-1093), the
   Constable and Marishal; but now the Constable and Marishal take
   not place as officers of the Crown, but according to their
   creation as Earls: the reason thereof I conceive to be, because
   of old offices did not prefer those who possessed them, but they
   took place according to their creation; whereas now the Privy
   Seal precedes all Dukes, and the Secretary takes place before all
   of his own rank; but the Constable and Marishal, being now the
   only two officers of the Crown that are heritable in Scotland,
   continue to possess as they did formerly. But in France, England,
   and all other places, the Constable and Marishal take place as
   officers of the Crown; and it seems very strange that these, who
   ride upon the King's right and left hand when he returns from his
   Parliaments, and who guard the Parliament itself, and the
   honours, should have no precedency by their offices; and yet I
   cannot deny, but that of old other Earls were placed before them;
   for in the former Charter granted by King Alexander, Malcolm Earl
   of Fife is placed before them. And I conceive their precedency
   has not risen of late to the same proportion with others,
   because, of late, our armies have been commanded by other
   officers, and so there was little use for the Constable and
   Marishal."</p>

<h3>
<span>THE BOWYER BIBLE.
(Vol. v., pp. 248. 309.)</span>
</h3>

<p>Seeing a fresh notice of this great book in No. 124. of "N. &amp; Q.," I
venture to forward a few particulars concerning Bowyer, who was an old
friend, even of between thirty and forty years' standing. He is long
since gone to his rest; he has left neither widow nor child, scarcely a
distant relative, so that the following can neither "give offence nor
grieve." He has often told me particulars of his early career. Being a
poor youth in search of employment, and withal moody enough at his
prospects, he was one day walking down Newgate Street, and pausing to
look at a print or two in a shop-window, it struck him he could take a
likeness; so he went home to his indifferent lodging, having procured
implements suitable, seated himself before a glass, and took his own
portrait, which he considered was as successful as a first effort could
be. Encouraged thereby, he was soon employed to paint others, and such
note did he acquire that his miniatures were carried into court-circles,
so that he became a sort of celebrity in that line, and Queen Charlotte
appointed him her official miniature-painter&mdash;if such be the proper
term.</p>

<p>He soon struck out much more important occupation, planning various
publications, the most promising of which was his large edition of
Hume's <i>History of England</i>; and this was so ponderous an undertaking
that it was only at last disposed of by a lottery. His fondness for
taking portraits never left him, and a very few years before his death
he gratified my family by volunteering to paint a miniature of my
father, and a capital likeness it was. He was much pleased with one of
his successes, of which he has more than once told me with great glee.
Just before George III. was secluded finally from public view, he and
another artist, an old acquaintance, went one Sunday together to the
Chapel-Royal at Windsor, and during the service each sketched the King
on <i>one of his nails</i>: they adjourned to an inn, and while the
impression was yet fresh, transferred to a sheet of paper the likeness
of the venerable monarch. On returning with it to London, Bowyer sent it
for the inspection of the Prince Regent, who was so pleased with this
rough pencil-drawing, that he sent word back he would never part with
it, and begged to know Bowyer's price. The latter said<a id="Page_351"></a> <span class="pagenum">[351]</span> 105<i>l.</i>,
which the Prince Regent immediately forwarded.</p>

<p>I once found Bowyer drawing at a table, a wig placed on a stick before
him, and he was taking the likeness of a very old friend, who was dead
and gone, from memory. In this attempt he entirely succeeded, even to
the surprise of all who knew the deceased.</p>

<p>About ten years ago a little book, called <i>Henry VIII. and his
Contemporaries</i>, by B. Bensley, contained, concerning the earlier
impressions of the Bible, the following note:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"I trust to be pardoned for introducing a little anecdote
   relative to the Bible, exactly three hundred years after the
   period about which I am writing, that is not the less appropriate
   for being likewise illustrative of <i>episcopal shrewdness</i>. [The
   text is recording an instance of the then Bishop of London being
   bitten in an arrangement with a bookseller.] The most splendid
   Bible ever issued was that published by Macklin, printed by my
   late father, and the execution of which even his son may say,
   would alone hand down his name to posterity. <i>Bowyer</i>, publisher
   of another great national work&mdash;the folio edition of Hume's
   <i>History of England</i>, also a splendid specimen of my father's
   typography&mdash;had a copy of Macklin's Bible, which he employed his
   leisure during many years to illustrate, having the best
   opportunities, from his pursuits as an artist, publisher of
   prints, &amp;c. On the completion of his labours, he valued the massy
   product, consisting of an immense number of prints, at 2500<i>l.</i>;
   and, after unsuccessful efforts to procure a purchaser, he put it
   up to be raffled for, issuing proposals to the nobility and
   gentry, &amp;c. Among others, an aged <i>bishop</i> sent his name as a
   subscriber to this kind of lottery, and shortly after called at
   the rooms in Pall Mall to pay the two guineas; but, before he did
   so, he drew Mr. Bowyer apart, and gravely told him he could not
   quite make out how, by paying that sum, he could <i>ensure</i>
   possession of the great work. Upon its being explained to his
   lordship, that he could only take a chance with 1249 others, he
   expressed surprise and vexation, and declined to pay two guineas
   for the chance, which he <i>then</i>, probably, saw was objectionable
   in a moral point of view, as a species of gambling! The parties
   are all long since dead."</p>

<span><i>Exeter Controversy</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 126.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent A. N. will
find, probably, that the "Exeter Controversy," to which Gifford alludes,
was that between John Agate, of St. Mary Arches Church, in Exeter, and
John Withers, a Presbyterian. The controversy commenced in 1707, and was
carried on with great violence till 1715. The tracts are numerous, but
many very scarce. Agate's chief tract was entitled <i>Plain Truth</i>, and is
in three parts, Exon, 1708. Withers replied in a work of three parts
also: <i>Truth Try'd, or Mr. Agate's pretended Plain Truth proved an
Untruth</i>, Exon, 1708-9-10. This of course called forth a rejoinder, and
so on. Although carried on with great personalities, the controversy
shows considerable ability on both sides. I possess almost all the
tracts, and shall be happy to send a list to A. N., if required.
Withers, Trosse, and Pierce are all well-known Dissenting names in the
history of Exeter at the beginning of last century, when that city was
the stronghold of Arianism.</p>

<span><i>Coleridge's "Friend"</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 297.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The passage quoted by your
correspondent J. M. can refer to one man only, viz. Thomas Wedgewood.
His introduction to that gentleman, and his brother Josiah, is related
by Cottle. (<i>Recollections of Coleridge</i>, 1837, vol. i. p. 305.)
Coleridge might well call the former his "munificent co-patron;" for we
learn from Cottle that these brothers, soon after making the poet's
acquaintance, settled upon him 150<i>l.</i> per annum, in order to prevent
him sinking the man of letters in the Unitarian minister. Cottle adds:</p>

<p>   "Mr. C. was oppressed with grateful emotions to these his liberal
   benefactors. He always spoke, in particular, of the late Mr.
   Thomas Wedgewood as being one of the best talkers, and as
   possessing one of the acutest minds of any man he had known."</p>

<p>The following details, which J. M. will not find in any book, may be
interesting, to him:&mdash;Joseph Wedgewood, the illustrious potter, lived at
<i>Etruria</i>, in Staffordshire; for such was the appropriate name of the
house he built for himself. He had six children,&mdash;three sons, John,
Thomas, and Josiah; and three daughters, Sarah, Catherine, and ****.
John married a Miss Allen (one of four Devonshire lasses), who was
accounted one of the most accomplished and excellent ladies in the
county. Joshua married another of the sisters. Thomas never married. He
was indisposed, both from ill health and taste, towards the pottery
business, and took to philosophy. He was endowed with a rare genius, and
enjoyed the society of the first <i>literati</i> of his day. But he died
while he was still a man of <i>promise</i>.</p>

<p>Of his sisters, Sarah was an accomplished lady with a strong intellect,
which captivated Basil Montagu, without reciprocity. Catherine was a
first-rate horse-woman. The third daughter married the celebrated Dr.
Darwin, of Shrewsbury. All of them, I believe, are dead.</p>

<p>In reading the other day Victor Hugo's <i>Notre Dame</i>, I met with the word
<i>Pignon</i>, which has exactly the same signification as the Welsh word
<i>Piniwn, the gable or pine end of a house</i>. Is the French word derived
from the Welsh, or the Welsh from the French? or is the coincidence in
sound and sense purely accidental? Perhaps some of your Welsh

<p><i>Rex Lucifer.</i>&mdash;It would be a most horrid barbarism to impute to such a
Latin poet as Milton the use of this word for the devil; although in his
theological poem he may have adopted that popular and discreditable
gloss upon Isaiah xiv. The palace of the light-bringing king is no other
than that known to our earliest school-days, in Ovid 1. ad fin. 2. ad

<p>&mdash;Miss Porter's
letter speaks of the piety and domestic concord of the Seawards. Your
readers may be amused to know that this piety affords one proof of the
fiction of the narrative. They sometimes give the dates both of the day
of month and week, and derive together much comfort from the singular
applicability of passages in the lessons for the day. When I was reading
the book, the days of the month and week fell the same as in the
narrative, and as it happened to be at the same time of year too, I made
the unpalatable discovery, that, however suitable the passages might be,
they were not as they professed to be, at least not always, from the
lesson of the day.</p>

<span><i>Spanish Verses on the Invasion of England</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 294.).&mdash;</span>
</h4>

<p>L. H. J. T. will find the Spanish verses which form the subject of his Query
in Southey's <i>Quarterly Review</i> article on Lord Holland's <i>Life and
Writings of Lope de Vega</i> (<i>Quarterly Review</i>, vol. xviii. p. 6.),
together with the following lively version:</p>

<div class="poem">

        <p>"My brother Don John</p>
        <p> To England is gone,</p>
        <p> To kill the Drake,</p>
        <p>  And the Queen to take,</p>
        <p> And the heretics all to destroy;</p>
        <p> And he will give me,</p>
        <p>  When he comes back,</p>
        <p>A Lutheran boy</p>
        <p> With a chain round his neck;</p>
        <p>And Grandmamma</p>
        <p> From his share shall have</p>
        <p> A Lutheran maid</p>
        <p>To be her slave."</p>

</div>

<p>Southey's reference is, <i>Romancero General</i>. <i>Medina del Campo</i>, 1602,
ff. 35. The lines form part of "a child's poem, or, more properly, a
poem written in the character of a child (a species of playful
composition at that time popular among the Spaniards)," and are quoted
by Southey, together with an Ode by Luis de Gongora, to show the
exultant anticipation with which the success of the Armada, in which
expedition Lope de Vega had entered himself as a volunteer, was expected
by the Spaniards.</p>

 <p class="right"> E. V.</p>

<p>In the second volume of Mr. Ticknor's admirable <i>History of Spanish
Literature</i> will be found an English translation of the Spanish ballad
referred to by your correspondent L. H. J. T. I am<a id="Page_353"></a> <span class="pagenum">[353]</span> not quite sure
whether the Spanish ballad is given by Mr. Ticknor or not; but the
following is a part of the English translation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p class="noindent">  "And Bartolo, my brother,</p>
        <p>To England forth is gone,</p>
   <p class="noindent">  Where the Drake he means to kill;</p>
      <p> And the Lutherans every one,</p>
   <p class="noindent">  Excommunicate from God.</p>
        <p>Their Queen among the first</p>
   <p class="noindent">  He will capture and bring back,</p>
        <p>Like heretics accurs'd:</p>
   <p class="noindent">  And he promises, moreover,</p>
        <p>Amongst his spoils and gains,</p>
   <p class="noindent"> A heretic young serving-boy</p>
       <p> To give me, bound in chains;</p>
   <p class="noindent">  And for my lady grandmamma,</p>
        <p>Whose years such waiting crave,</p>
     <p class="noindent"> A little handy Lutheran,</p>
        <p>To be her maiden slave."</p>

</div>

<p>These stanzas are cited by Mr. Ticknor to illustrate the state of public
feeling which prevailed in Spain respecting Sir Francis Drake and his
countrymen. Lope de Vega was also, it will be remembered, the author of
a poem on Drake's last expedition and death, entitled <i>La Dragontea</i>.</p>

<p>&mdash;With respect to the somewhat modern
imposture of the Paris Templars, E. A. H. L. had better consult Thilo's
<i>Codex Apocryphus</i>. In the generality of foreign masonic books he will
find the derivation of the Freemasons from the Templars asserted as
being their tradition. As to "the succession of Grand Masters kept up"
by them, I question whether that is asserted by them, or elsewhere than
in the Parisian imposture. The masonic formularies called <i>Thuileur</i>,
and M. de Bonneville's <i>Ma√ßonnerie Ecossaise</i>, may be consulted. But the
history of the order subsequent to that worthy, Jacques de Molai, will
not there, or elsewhere, be traced. The facts of common external history
which relate to the abolition of that order, such as the foundation of
the Portuguese Order of Christ, will all be found in Wilke's <i>German
History of the Temple Order</i>.</p>

<p>E. A. H. L. will find a valuable Note, with reference to the principal
authorities, in Hallam's <i>Supplemental Notes</i>, p. 48. ff. See also
Mill's <i>History of Chivalry</i>. The Grand Masters, since the suppression,
seem to have been principally Frenchmen. The chief authority is, I
believe, the <i>Manuel des Templiers</i>, which is only sold to members of
the society.</p>

<p>&mdash;The legend repeated
to me whilst viewing the tomb of John Baret, some few years since, is
somewhat different from that related by your correspondent B<span class="smcap lowercase">URIENSIS</span>. A
portion of the roof over the tomb is elaborately diapered with stars of
lead gilt, collars of SS., and a monogram of the letters I.B., together
with the motto, "Grace me governe." (A specimen of the diaper is given
in Collings' <i>Gothic Ornaments</i>, 4to., London, 1848.) The sexton
informed me that the person commemorated by the emaciated figure had
undertaken to diaper the whole roof of the church in a manner similar to
the work above his tomb; but, on discovering that his life would be
insufficient for the task, was so affected that he starved himself to
death. I presume that Ba<i>n</i>t is a misprint for Ba<i>re</i>t, in p. 247. of
your present volume.</p>

<p>The tradition alluded to by your correspondent has been, I believe,
attached by some to the emaciated figure at St. Saviour's, Southwark. A
good example of this kind of memorial is found in the ante-chapel of St.
John's College Chapel, Cambridge.</p>

<p>What foundation is there for the account, that the superb roof of St.
Mary's, Bury St. Edmund's, was constructed in France, and put together
after it was brought to England?</p>

<span><i>Martinique</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 11.).</span>

reply of M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. P<span class="smcap lowercase">HILIP</span> S. K<span class="smcap lowercase">ING</span> (p. 165.) to the Query of your correspondent
W. J. C.</p>

<p>A reference to the few authorities to which I have access leads me to
suppose that the period of the actual discovery of this island is
involved in some obscurity. Washington Irving assumes its identity with
the island called by its inhabitants "Mantinino," and that it was the
first land made by Columbus on his fourth voyage to the West Indies in
1502. Mr. Major, in his Introduction to the <i>Select Letters of
Columbus</i>, published for the Hakluyt Society, inclines to the same
opinion. It is extremely probable that Columbus had heard reports of
this island when he was among the group of the Caribbees in 1493, but he
does not appear to have been then further south than the latitude of
Dominica. Peter Martyr, however, alludes to Mantinino, an island of
Amazons, as having been passed by the admiral to the <i>north</i> of
Guadaloupe, when on his course to Hispaniola. Assuming this to be an
error of position, and that the discovery of the island did not really
take place until the year 1502, the period at which Columbus was there
(June) could have had no influence on its new name, since the days of
the two Saints Martin are in November.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think that the name "Martinico" may have been conferred
by the Spaniards at some subsequent period; and, supposing it to be a
diminutive of <i>Martin</i>, in honour of the lesser St. Martin, pope and
martyr, and not him of Tours. <i>Martinique</i> is, of course, the same word
Gallicised.</p>

<span>(Vol. iv., p. 37.).</span>

<p>&mdash;It may be interesting to your
correspondent F. R. A. to learn that there is a notice of the demise of
the Rev. Thomas <i>Maurice</i>, not <i>Morris</i>, in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>
for 1748; but whether this is a typographical error of our old friend
Sylvanus Urban or not I am unable to discover, although I have made
every research in my power. The celebrated Wordsworth, with other minor
poets, have drawn fanciful pictures of the old divine; but, from what
little may be learned of his history in the paragraph of his decease
above referred to, it is quite evident that all are very far from
depicting the real character of the individual who chose such an
eccentric epitaph as the sole word</p>

      <p class="center">"M<span class="smcap lowercase">ISERRIMUS</span>;"</p>


<p class="noindent">for he is there said to have been "a gentleman very charitable to the
poor, and much esteemed."</p>

<p>The original stone which covered his remains, having the word
"Miserrimus" spelt with a single <i>r</i>, being nearly obliterated, was
renewed many years since by, I believe, one of the gentlemen connected
with the cathedral. Your correspondent is correct in stating the work
alluded to as being written by the late F. M. Reynolds. I should feel

<p class="noindent">forms the Fifth Number of Handel's celebrated <i>Chamber Duets</i>, and was
first printed, I believe, by the late Dr. Samuel Arnold, in his noble
edition of the <i>Works of Handel</i>.</p>

<p>The circumstances attending the composition of these chamber duets are
thus alluded to in the anonymous <i>Memoirs of Handel</i>, 8vo., 1759, p.
85.:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Soon after his [Handel's] return to Hanover [in the year 1711],
   he made twelve Chamber Duettos, for the practice of the late

<p>I must, however, beg leave to express my opinion that M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> S<span class="smcap lowercase">PARROW</span>'s MS.
is <i>not</i> an <i>autograph</i> of the great composer, on the ground that the

<h4>
<span><i>Fernseed</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 172.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;This was considered a charm of the
highest potency. It not only preserved the fortunate possessor against
the malignant influences of demon, witch, and sorcerer, but enabled him
to render himself invisible at pleasure:</p>

  <div class="poem">

 <p>   "We have the receipt of fern-seed, we walk invisible,"</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">quoth <i>honest</i> Gadshill (<i>Henry IV.</i>, Part I. Act II. Sc. 1.). The
difficulty and danger with which it could only be obtained, apparently
tended much to enhance its magical value in the estimation of the
cabalist. It was to be gathered, after solemn fasting, and the
performance of mystic ceremonies now unknown, on Midsummer Eve, at the
very instant in which the Baptist's birth took place. The spiritual
world was arrayed in fierce hostility against the daring gatherer. The
fairies used every effort to preserve it from human possession, with an
inveteracy which showed what high value they put upon it. As to the
danger resulting from their hostility, Richard Bovet, in his
<i>Pand√¶monium</i> (p. 217., London, 1684), gives curious evidence:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "Much discourse hath been about gathering of fern-seed (which is
   looked upon as a magical herb) on the night of Midsummer Eve; and
   I remember I was told of one who went to gather it, and the
   spirits whisk't by his ears like bullets, and sometimes struck
   his hat, and other parts of his body; in fine, though he
   apprehended he had gotten a quantity of it, and secured it in
   papers, and a box besides, when he came home he found all empty.
   But, most probable, this appointing of times and hours is of the
   devil's own institution, as well as the fast; that having once
   ensnared people to an obedience to his rules, he may with more
   facility oblige them to stricter vassalage."</p>

<p>The fern-seed charm is amply discussed in Brand's <i>Popular Antiquities</i>,
vol. i. p. 314. (Bohn's edition.)</p>

<p>Any of your readers who have access to an amusing book called <i>The
Radical</i>, by Samuel Bamford, may see most appalling account of an
adventure connected with the gathering of fern-seed, and other
superstitions.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Longevity and Rejuvenescency</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 276.).</span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;I beg to refer your
sceptical correspondent to Fuller's <i>Worthies</i> (county of
Northumberland) for a remarkable instance of longevity; viz. Patrick
Machell Vivan, Vicar of Lesbury, near Alnwick. Percival Stockdale, in
his <i>Memoirs</i>, gives some further particulars respecting his
predecessor; and I extract from that work (vol. i. p. 149.) a letter
written by the venerable old man, wherein he gives an account of
himself. It is dated Oct. 9, 1657, and addressed to one William Lialkus,
a citizen of Antwerp.</p>

<p>   "Whereas you desired a true and faithful messenger should be sent
   from Newcastle to the parish of Lesbury, to inquire concerning
   John Maklin; I gave you to understand that no such man was known
   ever to be, or hath lived there for these fifty years past,
   during which time I, Patrick Makel Wian, have been minister of
   that parish, wherein I have all that time been present, taught,
   and do yet continue to teach there. But that I may give you some
   satisfaction, you shall understand that I was born in Galloway in
   Scotland, in the year 1546, bred up in the University of
   Edinburgh, where I commenced Master of Arts, whence, travelling
   into England, I kept school, and sometimes preached, till in the
   first of King James I was inducted into the church of Lesbury,
   where I now live. As to what concerns the change of my body, it
   is now the third year since I had two new teeth, one in my upper,
   the other in my nether jaw, as is apparent to the touch. My
   sight, much decayed many years ago, is now, about the 110th year
   of my age, become clearer; hair adorns me heretofore bald skull.
   I was never of a fat, but a slender mean habit of body. My diet
   has ever been moderate, nor was I ever accustomed to feasting and
   tippling: hunger is the best sauce; nor did I ever use to feed to
   satiety. All this is most certain and true, which I have
   seriously, though overhastily, confirmed to you, under the hand
   of P<span class="smcap lowercase">ATRICK</span> M<span class="smcap lowercase">AKEL</span> W<span class="smcap lowercase">IAN</span>, Minister of Lesbury."</p>

<p>Mr. Stockdale adds, that there is a tradition that when the Plague
visited Lesbury, in the reign of Charles II., those who were infected
were removed to tents on the neighbouring moor, where the venerable
pastor attended them with great assiduity, ministering to their wants
temporal and spiritual. The date of his death is unknown.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Indignities on the Bodies of Suicides</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 272.).</span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;I much
doubt whether burying in cross roads was originally meant as an
indignity. I think this is nearly connected with my still unanswered
Query, <i>What is a Tye?</i> Vol. iii., p. 263. I suspect suicides were
buried in a cross road, because that was a place where a cross or
crucifix stood, and only second in sanctity to the churchyard; and the
stake driven through the body was perhaps first intended not as an
insult, but to keep the ghost of the suicide from walking on the earth
again.</p>

<p>I would willingly believe our ancestors were<a id="Page_357"></a> <span class="pagenum">[357]</span> not always such
savages as R. S. F. shows us the Scotch once were in this respect. I
fear at that time we were not much better.</p>

<p>To my previous Note, I beg leave to append a passage from Arnot's
<i>Criminal Trials</i> (p. 368.), which may tend to throw some light on this
subject. In speaking of the witch prosecutions in Scotland, this writer
says:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "If an unfortunate woman, trembling at a citation for witchcraft,
   ended her sufferings by her own hand, she was dragged from her
   house at a horse's tail, and buried under the gallows."</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Large Families</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., pp. 204. 304.).</span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;To the instances of
unusually large numbers of children by one mother given in "N. &amp; Q." may
be added that of a Lady Elphinstone, who is said, by tradition, to have
had no less than thirty-six children, of whom twenty-seven were living
at one time.</p>

<p>There is a story told of this lady and her husband, Lord Elphinstone,
which seems to corroborate the tradition; it is, that they once asked a
new and somewhat bashful acquaintance to visit them, telling him that he
should meet no one but their family circle. Their guest arrived shortly
before dinner, and, being shown through the dining-hall on his way to
the drawing-room, was much disconcerted at seeing a long table laid for
about twenty people. On remonstrating with his host and hostess for
having taken him in, as he thought, he was quietly informed that he had
been told no more than the truth, for that their family party, when all
assembled, only fell short of <i>thirty</i> by <i>one</i>.</p>

<p>I believe that John eighth Lord Elphinstone and his lady, a daughter of
the Earl of Lauderdale, who lived in the latter part of the seventeenth
and beginning of the eighteenth centuries, are the pair to whom this
story refers; and, though the Scotch peerages make no mention of any
such phenomenon in the Elphinstone family, yet I am strongly inclined,
from the goodness of the authority from which I derive the tradition, to
believe it to be true; the more so, as it is now acknowledged that the
Scotch peerages, not excepting Douglas's, which has hitherto been the
chief book of reference respecting the noble families of Scotland, are
so full of errors and omissions, that very little reliance can be placed
on them.</p>

<p>Can any of your readers inform me whether any documentary evidence
exists that a lady Elphinstone had this extraordinary number of
children?</p>

   <p class="right"> C. E. D.</p>



<h4>
<span><i>Twenty-seven Children, &amp;c.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;About fifty years ago, Mrs. Edwards,
residing in Quickset Row, New Road, had her twenty-eighth child, each a
single birth; they were all born alive, and all lived several months,
but she never had more than ten living at a time.</p>

<p>A former pupil of mine knew a lady, of whom he wrote to me, that she had
borne thirty children, all single births; seven only of them arrived at
the age of manhood. He says, "This statement may be relied upon with the
utmost confidence as a fact."</p>

<h4>
<span><i>The last of the Pal√¶ologi</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 280.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;This is a most
interesting subject; I beg to refer your readers to <i>Arch√¶ologia</i>, vol.
xviii. p. 93., and to Burn's <i>History of Foreign Refugees</i>, p. 230.</p>

<h3>
<span>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</span>
</h3>


<p>The readers of "N. &amp; Q." who are lovers of Folk Lore are, we well know,
very numerous; those who take an interest in that subject, and are at
the same time acquainted with the great philological acquirements of the
learned editor of the <i>Ancient Laws and Institutes of England</i>, we have
no doubt shared our satisfaction at the announcement that Mr. Thorpe had
undertaken a work, comprehensive yet not too voluminous, in which he
would exhibit the ancient mythology and principal mythologic traditions
of Scandinavia and the North of Germany. The book is now before us; and
in three small volumes, entitled <i>Northern Mythology, comprising the
principal popular Traditions and Superstitions of Scandinavia, North
Germany, and the Netherlands</i>, Mr. Thorpe has presented us with such an
amount of information illustrative of the intimate connexion subsisting
between the heathenism of the Germanic nations of the Continent and that
of our Saxon forefathers, gathered from the writings of the best
scholars of Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and the Low Countries, as was
never before within the reach of the mere English student, and, in so
doing, has produced a book which the general reader will devour for the
sake of the amusement to be found in it, the philosopher for the view of
the human mind which it presents, and the antiquary for the abundance of
new light which it throws upon many of the most obscure points in the
Folk Lore of Merry England. We shall probably often have occasion to
refer to it, in illustration of communications upon a subject which is
yet far from exhausted.</p>

<p>We were reminded, by the excellent explanation of the word <i>Bigot</i>,
quoted by a correspondent in our last Number (p. 331.) from the Rev. R.
Chevenix Trench's Lectures <i>On the Study of Words</i>, of a duty we owed to
our readers, namely, that of calling their attention more directly to
this admirable little volume. The Lectures, which are "On the Morality
in Words," "On the History in Words," "On the Rise of New Words," "On
the Distinction of Words," and "The Schoolmaster's Use of Words," may be
said to be a continuous and well-digested series of proofs of the truth
of the remark, that "there are cases in which more knowledge of more
value may be conveyed by the history of a word, than<a id="Page_358"></a> <span class="pagenum">[358]</span> by the
history of a campaign." The book is, indeed, altogether a delightful
one, calculated not only to delight the understanding, but do so in such
a spirit as shall leave the reader a better as well as a wiser man.</p>

<p><i>Fraser's Magazine</i> for the present month opens with an article on a
subject which will doubtless interest many of our readers. It is
entitled <i>The Colleges of Oxford</i>, and exhibits, with much clearness, a
sketch of their origin and history, and is obviously introductory to the
consideration of their future policy.</p>

<p><i>The Afghans, the Ten Tribes, and the Kings of the East. The Druses, the
Moabites</i>, by the Right Hon. Sir G. H. Rose, is, as the ample title
shows, an endeavour to establish the identity of the Afghans with the
Ten Tribes, and of the Druses with the Moabites; and the argument is
carried on in a manner which reflects the highest credit upon the
learning and reverent spirit of the writer.</p>

<p><i>The Orations of Marcus Tullius Cicero literally translated</i>, by C. D.
Yonge, vol. iii., is the new volume of Bohn's <i>Classical Library</i>, and
contains the orations for his house, Plancius, Sextius, C√¶lius, Milo,
Ligarius, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>A few Remarks on the Emendation "Who Smothers her with Painting," in
the Play of Cymbeline, discovered by Mr. Collier in a corrected Copy of
the Second Edition of Shakspeare</i>, by J. O. Halliwell. A pamphlet in
which Mr. Halliwell defends the old reading,</p>

 <div class="poem">

  <p>"Whose mother was her painting,"</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">against the ingenious suggestion of the anonymous emendator of Mr.
Collier's second folio.</p>
